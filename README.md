# Breaker-iOS
iOS app to control additions to my apartment.

Currently it allows me to turn the air conditioner on and off by making requests to a Spark Core that actuates a servo to press the AC's power button.

Added a Today Widget so that I can quickly toggle the AC just by swiping down from the lock-screen
